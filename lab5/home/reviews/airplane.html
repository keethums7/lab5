            <em>Airplane</em> is a parody of the disaster films of the 1960's and 70's. Ted Striker, the main
            protagonist,
            is a war veteran with an (understandable) fear of flying. When his girlfriend, Elaine, breaks up with him
            before
            her upcoming flight - she works as a flight attendant - Ted boards the flight to try and keep his
            relationship
            intact and win Elaine back.<br><br>
            When a bout of food poisoning threatens to take down the entire plane, it's up to Ted and everyone else
            spared
            from the tainted food to safely land the plane. Easier said than done.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Score: 8/10</strong> - Airplane is...silly. It is ridiculous and an easy laugh, and you should watch
            it
            simply because it's stupid and
            enjoyable. There will be no lesson or takeaway, and you won't be smarter for having watched it, but gosh
            darn it
            it's lovely.
            With Leslie Nielsen as one of the pilots of the plane, and a whole slew of other terrific comedic talent,
            this is a classic that is surely worth the watch.
