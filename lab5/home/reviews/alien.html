            In the year 2122, members of the space freighter Nostromo are met with a deadly discovery. Awakened from
            their stasis en route back to Earth from their contracted work, the crew is informed that a distress signal
            from a nearby planet was received and - following company policy - they are tasked with investigating the
            signal.<br>
            When they arrive, they quickly trace the signal to a seemingly alien spacecraft. Aboard the craft, the
            intrepid crew encounters pods or eggs for some sort of lifeform.<br>
            One unlucky member, Kane, is attacked by a creature emerging from these eggs and it latches onto his face
            through his space helmet.<br><br>
            Once back on the ship, the "facehugger" as it's affectionately called, uses Kane's body as a cocoon, and
            soon hatches as its secondary form - a Xenomorph - a terrifying, slimy, toxic, and bloodthirsty nightmare of
            a creature.<br>
            Small at first, it grows incredibly quickly, and one by one begins picking off the crew.<br>
            In the end, only Ripley remains, the main protagonist and the most sensible of the crew, she barely manages
            to survive in an escape pod after the alien has already eliminated the others. Using the airlock doors,
            Ripley is able to eject the Xenomorph into the vacuum of space at the last moment and save herself.<br>
            <br><br>
            Alien is an amazing addition to any movie collection. Though the rest of the series is a mixed bag, this
            first
            movie nails what it means to feel afraid and confined. The crew, slowly picked off one by one, such a cruel
            fate
            to live through - and the cast plays their roles perfectly.
            <br>These space farers aren't all scientists and doctors, most of them are blue collar working class
            denizens of
            future Earth. They work for a corporation that sacrifices their safety in the name of potential earnings for
            its
            new "weapon" (a.k.a. the Xenomorph).
            <br><br>In our dark times of profits above people and a fear of dystopia looming overhead, Alien still works
            on
            so many levels today that it could have been written this year and it'd fit right into today's cultural
            commentary.
            <br><br><strong>Score: 9/10</strong> - There are few flaws in this one, it's from 1979 so there are a few
            moments that may have
            you doing a double-take, but it holds up so well and highlights the very real threat of the unknown. We
            often
            dream of a chance encounter with life from another world, rarely do we see those dreams become nightmares.
