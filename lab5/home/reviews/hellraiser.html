			<h2>Hellraiser: A Few Novel Successes, Many Failures</h2>
			<h3>A few things to know about Hellraiser:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Hellraiser is written and directed by Clive Barker.</li>
				<li>The story is based on a 1986 novella, written by Clive Barker - <em>The Hellbound Heart</em>&sup2;
				</li>
				<li>The face of the brand is <strong>Pinhead</strong> - a <i>cenobite</i> - a being from another plane
					of
					reality <em>(I know, I know...)</em> that revel in pain as a form of twisted pleasure, or something
					like
					that.
				</li>
				<li>Since you asked, here's a highly opinionated list of the Hellraiser films - with 1 being the best
					and 11 being the worst.
				<li><strong>Hellraiser Films - Best to Worst</strong></li>
				<ol>
					<li>Hellraiser (1987) - The O.G. - Clive Barker got it right the first time.</li>
					<li>Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988) - In many ways just more of the first film, expanding on the
						main character just jumped forward in time.</li>
					<li>Hellraiser (2022) - A completly new set of characters, a satisfying ending, an acceptable modern
						update on the classic.</li>
					<li>Hellraiser: Bloodline (1996) - Truly not a great movie by any means. The selling point is that
						it details the origins of the series MacGuffin - the Lament Configuration (the puzzle box).</li>
					<li>Hellraiser: Hellseeker (2002) - The leading character of the first two films returns, but the
						series was already well beyond redemption at this point.</li>
					<li>Hellraiser: Deader (2005) - This is a very middle of the ground film for the series, it tries a
						new cast of characters but it falls a little short of the best of the series.</li>
					<li>Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992) - Just way cornier than the first two
						films, a
						very big
						let down. We do get a human origin story for Pinhead though, which is
						neat.</li>
					<li>Hellraiser: Hellworld (2005) Pinhead and the cenobites <em>in an MMORPG like <strong>World of
								Warcraft</strong></em>. Fun!</li>
					<li>Hellraiser: Inferno (2000) - This is a cop drama that happens to have Pinhead in it as an
						afterthought!</li>
					<li>Hellraiser: Revelations (2011) - <q>I have NOTHING to do with the ---- thing.</q> - <em>Clive
							Barker, creator of Hellraiser</em> -

					</li>
					<li>Hellraiser: Judgement (2018) - Difficult to watch, clearly going for shock value above all else.
					</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Score: 5/10 - Like many horror series from the 80's and 90's, the desparate attempts by the studios to
				hold
				onto the creative rights means its flooded with entries that lack effort and heart.<br>The first few
				movies,
				and the most recent remake, are all worth a watch - otherwise skip this section of the horror aisle.</p>

Hellraiser will always hold a place in my heart 
as a silly film series that I have seen every iteration of with my wife,
despite how difficult some of them were to finish.
